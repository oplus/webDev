I have also often dreamed of writing my own blog about whatever a topic that will keep me motivated to write and further explore. The fact that my life-time passion was always about programming and technology in general has motivated me to start this blog. I started mingling in programming and Python in 2014, thus 3 years from the date of writing this blog. Recently, I found that SJ is one of the most powerful languages that will help construct either web, mobile and even desktop and embedded systems application. 

            I started this blog to help organize my thoughts. I will post on a random basis without following a definite path or course. I will share whatever draw my attention in JS or any other language wether it is code snippits, platforms, or random thoughts. 

            I hope the quality of this blog will improve along with my skills.</span>
